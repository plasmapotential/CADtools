# CADtools
tools for CAD operations

this repo contains various tools for interacting with CAD.  Some of the scripts require the HEAT environment,
which can be obtained via a docker container as descibed in the tutorials for HEAT.  See the HEAT github repo
for more info: https://github.com/plasmapotential/HEAT

Other scripts require the freecad python libraries, which can be installed independently, or can be accessed
in the aforementioned HEAT docker container.
